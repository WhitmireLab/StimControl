PASSIVE ACQUISITION

TO DO - URGENT
- CLOSING DOESN'T WORK
- binning doesn't work
- warnings when starting preview
- preview start doesn't work - static image only?
- indicator for when saturation (brightness) is reaching full intensity so we know to adjust gain / light
- jank when changing bin size / folders / etc
- creating new animal may also create erroneous experiment folders if you're ALSO changing experiment
- Figure out the buffering issues for multi-image-per-trigger acquisition, maybe thread it
TO DO - LATER
- program in the active acquisition (stim control necessary? or rely on existing programs only -> 
		might be a bit wasted effort to set up stim here if you're also going to set up
		a full stim program as your next thing? ask C.
- program in teensy

PHILL IMPROVEMENTS
- Programmatically set ROI and save from prev session
- MASKING (either programmatic or just let someone draw it)
- be able to also see deltaF/F (set pre-stim time and set average for pre-stim as zero)
	for fluorescence trace: (F - F0) / F0
