TO DO - URGENT
- warnings when starting preview
- preview start doesn't work - static image only?
- Figure out the buffering issues for multi-image-per-trigger acquisition, maybe thread it
- creating new animal may also create erroneous experiment folders if you're ALSO changing experiment
- make sure camera properly closes when you close the software
- go through previous stuff

SET TRIGGER REPEAT SOMEWHERE
NB NEED TO WAIT??? - https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/722643-how-to-receive-hardware-triggers-multiple-times-using-image-acquisition-toolbox

TO DO - LATER
- program in the active acquisition (stim control necessary? or rely on existing programs only -> 
		might be a bit wasted effort to set up stim here if you're also going to set up
		a full stim program as your next thing? ask C.
