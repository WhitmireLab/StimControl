TO DO - URGENT
- Figure out the buffering issues for multi-image-per-trigger acquisition, maybe thread it
- Put an indicator that the program is actively imaging (if frame has been received within shutterspeed + tolerance)


TO DO - LATER
- program in the active acquisition (stim control necessary? or rely on existing programs only -> 
		might be a bit wasted effort to set up stim here if you're also going to set up
		a full stim program as your next thing? ask C.
- Clean up GUI, fix up README, do some proper dry runs.
